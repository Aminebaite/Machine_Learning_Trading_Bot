In this Project, we’ll assume the role of a financial advisor at one of the top five financial advisory firms in the world. Our firm constantly competes with the other major firms to manage and automatically trade assets in a highly dynamic environment. In recent years, our firm has heavily profited by using computer algorithms that can buy and sell faster than human traders.

The speed of these transactions gave our firm a competitive advantage early on. But, people still need to specifically program these systems, which limits their ability to adapt to new data. We’re thus planning to improve the existing algorithmic trading systems and maintain the firm’s competitive advantage in the market. To do so, we’ll enhance the existing trading signals with machine learning algorithms that can adapt to new data.

We’ll combine our new algorithmic trading skills with your existing skills in financial Python programming and machine learning to create an algorithmic trading bot that learns and adapts to new data and evolving markets.

In a Project, we’ll do the following:

    -Implement an algorithmic trading strategy that uses machine learning to automate the trade decisions.

    -Adjust the input parameters to optimize the trading algorithm.

    -Train a new machine learning model and compare its performance to that of a baseline model.
    
    
## Technologies : 
This project leverages Anaconda and Jupyterlab with Python 3.7:



We need also to import the following libraries and dependencies :
```
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from pathlib import Path
import hvplot.pandas
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn import svm
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from pandas.tseries.offsets import DateOffset
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
```
